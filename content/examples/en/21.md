# MongoDB Aggregation Query In-depth Analysis

MongoDB's aggregation framework provides powerful data processing capabilities.

## Aggregation Pipeline

Aggregation operations process data through pipelines:

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "completed" } },
  { $group: { 
    _id: "$customerId", 
    totalAmount: { $sum: "$amount" },
    orderCount: { $sum: 1 }
  }},
  { $sort: { totalAmount: -1 } },
  { $limit: 10 }
]);
```

## Performance Optimization

```javascript
// Use indexes to optimize aggregation queries
db.orders.createIndex({ status: 1, customerId: 1 });
```

## Practical Applications

In real projects, we need to pay attention to the following points:

1. **Performance Considerations** - Choose appropriate technical solutions
2. **Maintainability** - Keep code clean and documentation complete
3. **Scalability** - Prepare for future requirement changes
4. **Security** - Ensure application security protection

## Summary

Through this article, we have gained a deep understanding of the core concepts and practical methods of related technologies. I hope this content can help you better apply these technologies in actual development.
