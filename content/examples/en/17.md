# Docker Containerization Deployment Best Practices

Docker containerization technology has revolutionized application deployment methods.

## Dockerfile Optimization

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build
FROM node:16-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - redis
      - postgres
```

## Practical Applications

In real projects, we need to pay attention to the following points:

1. **Performance Considerations** - Choose appropriate technical solutions
2. **Maintainability** - Keep code clean and documentation complete
3. **Scalability** - Prepare for future requirement changes
4. **Security** - Ensure application security protection

## Summary

Through this article, we have gained a deep understanding of the core concepts and practical methods of related technologies. I hope this content can help you better apply these technologies in actual development.
