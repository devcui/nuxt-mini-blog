# Advanced TypeScript Type System Deep Dive

TypeScript provides a powerful type system that allows us to write safer and more maintainable code.

## Generics

Generics allow us to write reusable code components:

```typescript
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}

interface GenericIdentityFn<T> {
  (arg: T): T;
}
```

## Conditional Types

```typescript
type ApiResponse<T> = T extends string 
  ? { message: T } 
  : { data: T };
```

Conditional types allow us to determine the final type based on type conditions.

## Practical Applications

In real projects, we need to pay attention to the following points:

1. **Performance Considerations** - Choose appropriate technical solutions
2. **Maintainability** - Keep code clean and documentation complete
3. **Scalability** - Prepare for future requirement changes
4. **Security** - Ensure application security protection

## Summary

Through this article, we have gained a deep understanding of the core concepts and practical methods of related technologies. I hope this content can help you better apply these technologies in actual development.
