# Webpack 5 New Features and Configuration Optimization

Webpack 5 brings many exciting new features that significantly improve build performance.

## Module Federation

Module Federation is the most important new feature of Webpack 5:

```javascript
const ModuleFederationPlugin = require('@module-federation/webpack');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: 'host',
      remotes: {
        remote: 'remote@http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js'
      }
    })
  ]
};
```

## Persistent Caching

```javascript
module.exports = {
  cache: {
    type: 'filesystem',
    buildDependencies: {
      config: [__filename]
    }
  }
};
```

## Practical Applications

In real projects, we need to pay attention to the following points:

1. **Performance Considerations** - Choose appropriate technical solutions
2. **Maintainability** - Keep code clean and documentation complete
3. **Scalability** - Prepare for future requirement changes
4. **Security** - Ensure application security protection

## Summary

Through this article, we have gained a deep understanding of the core concepts and practical methods of related technologies. I hope this content can help you better apply these technologies in actual development.
