# Node.js Performance Optimization Practical Guide

Node.js application performance optimization requires analysis and improvement from multiple dimensions.

## Event Loop Optimization

Understanding the event loop is the foundation of optimization:

```javascript
// Avoid blocking the event loop
function heavyComputation() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setImmediate(() => {
      // Computation logic
      resolve(result);
    });
  });
}
```

## Memory Management

```javascript
// Monitor memory usage
const memUsage = process.memoryUsage();
console.log('Memory Usage:', {
  rss: Math.round(memUsage.rss / 1024 / 1024) + ' MB',
  heapTotal: Math.round(memUsage.heapTotal / 1024 / 1024) + ' MB',
  heapUsed: Math.round(memUsage.heapUsed / 1024 / 1024) + ' MB'
});
```

## Practical Applications

In real projects, we need to pay attention to the following points:

1. **Performance Considerations** - Choose appropriate technical solutions
2. **Maintainability** - Keep code clean and documentation complete
3. **Scalability** - Prepare for future requirement changes
4. **Security** - Ensure application security protection

## Summary
